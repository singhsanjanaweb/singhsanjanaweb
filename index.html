<p id="about">
Hii..! I am Sanjana, and I am currently learning UI/UX and graphic design from Arena Animation. I have a passion for creativity and love designing digital experiences that are both beautiful and easy to use. As I go through this learning journey, I am gaining skills in UI/UX, prototyping, and graphic design using tools like  Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. I learn something new and apply my knowledge to real-world projects. In my free time, I love sketching, photography, Gaming, Traveling and experiencing different cultures also inspire my creativity. I am excited to keep learning and growing in this field!
